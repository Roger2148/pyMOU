# pyMOU
#### Light package for simulation and connectivity estimation using the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (MOU)


This Python library relies on the MOU process to simulate network activity and estimate connectivity from observed activity (Gilson et al. *PLoS Comput Biol* 2016; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/531830v2).

## Quick install using pip
